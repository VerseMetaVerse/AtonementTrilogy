IDEAS are worth nothing in the Gaming Industry since every person working in that business has many many ideas stored up over the years that just need "a little funding (or a lot)" and so one place for any ideas that anyone thinks could be of interest to people is just out in the open for no other reason than every story wants itself to be told..."

### What is Different

Although games, like books, can have infinite variations and there is always room for one more story, it is also true that every story that wants to be told wnats to have its own unique special place in the hearts of the reader

This story is one answer to Fermi's Paradox and also describes a future where AI does not not destroy us and creatures big and small generally try to work together against the vastness of the Universe

- no Zombies
- not RTS
- not Strategy
- an environment to be lived in where possible
