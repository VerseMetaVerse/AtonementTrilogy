Although games, like books, can have infinite variations and there is always room for one more story, it is also true that every story that wants to be told wnats to have its own unique special place in the hearts of the reader

This story is one answer to Fermi's Paradox and also describes a future where AI does not not destroy us and creatures big and small generally try to work together against the vastness of the Universe

- no Zombies
- not RTS
- not Strategy
